A website where aspiring musicians can upload their music and other users can provide critiques and suggestions for how they can improve.

This is much needed in a world where many artists upload their work to YouTube or Spotify and can't recieve any helpful feedback short of internet harrassment, likes, or just get ignored. This will provide a platform for serious users to get useful critiques of their music so that they may improve their skills and learn from others and create a community of such work.

Our project will use Data Storage (to store music),
