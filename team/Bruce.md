# Bruce Waters
I'm a senior Honors Computer Science Major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

I'm very interested in learning about and working on projects related to sustainability, data engineering, anthropology, and artificial intelligence.

I have experience programming with Java, C, Python, C++, and Javascript.

In my free time I like making and listening to music, reading, playing volleyball, board, and card games, and watching movies.
