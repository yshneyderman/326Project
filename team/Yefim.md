# Yefim Shneyderman
I'm a junior Computer Science and Mathematics Major at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

As a student I am very passionate about learning and love using technology to solve problems around me.

I'm very interested in learning about and working on UX/UI development, gamification, graphic design, sustainability, software development, and artificial intelligence.
I have lots of experience programming with Java, C, Python, and Javascript and I have taken a variety of classes in Programming, Math, Physics, Statistics, Environmental Science, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and more.

In my free time I like coding, hiking, painting, listening to music, reading, swimming, badminton, and watching my favorite movies.
