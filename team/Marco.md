# MARCO HERNANDEZ-MUNIZ
I'm a senior Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

I am passionate about learning and love using technology to solve problems around me.

I'm very interested in learning about and working on UX/UI development, graphic design, sustainability, software development, and artificial intelligence. I have lots of experience programming with Java, C, Python, and Javascript and I have taken a variety of classes in Programming, Math, Physics, Statistics, Environmental Science, Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, and more.

In my free time I like coding playing guitar, beating noobs at chess, and watching Yefim's favorite movies.
